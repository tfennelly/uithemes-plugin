 * UI Theme Contribution.

 * <p/>
 * A given theme "implementation" ({@link UIThemeImplementation}) can have multiple resources
 * "contributed" to it by Jenkins core (and/or 0+ plugins). If you think about the "icon" theme
 * and it's "classic" implementation, Jenkins core makes a theme resource contribution that defines
 * the core set of "classic" icons, but each of the plugins can also contribute to that same
 * theme implementation. The same obviously applies for other "icon" themes might be created
 * e.g. a "font-awesome" theme.
